Occamy is an open source protocol and proxy for modern remote desktop control that written in Go.

## To start using Occamy

### Build

Occamy support deployment with Docker or container orchestration tool, e.g. K8s. 
To build Occamy, you need:

```
git clone https://github.com/changkun/occamy.git
cd occamy
make build
```

Then you should be able to run occamy with:

```
docker run -itd occamy:latest
```

### APIs

Occamy offers two APIs:

- `/api/v1/login` distributes JWT tokens for authentication and
- `/api/v1/connect` is used for WebSocket based Occamy connection.

If you build Occamy with web client, you can also access `/static` for web client demo.

### Demo

To run a demo, you need build an occamy client first:

```
cd client/occamy-web
npm install && npm run build
```

With docker-compose, you should be able to run a working demo with:

```
make build
make run
make stop
```

Here is a working video demo:

## Why Occamy and how it works?

Occamy implements a generic remote desktop protocol with modern approaches. 
It currently performs [Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) protocol 
and eventually intends to redesign and propose Occamy protocol.

The benefits of Occamy that differ from Guacamole are:

- Authentication supports
- Simplified architecture
- Streaming compression and optimization
- Modern with Go

Occamy server side currently simplifies Guacamole proxy and 
Guacamole servlet client in a single middleware application. 
Any client that involves Guacamole protocol and uses WebSocket 
for authentication can directly switch to interact to Occamy 
without any changes.
